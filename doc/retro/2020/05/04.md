## Who

Matt & Julien & a bit of Steve

## What happened

Started implementing the manual remote repo fetch.

## Insights

Matt: the README is not helping people get up and running. I probably need to try and reinstall everything from scratch and see how it feels.
Julien: The setup instructions could get some love, I agree. Apart from that, the overall DX is pretty smooth. I enjoyed our session today.
Julien: I noticed the step definitions are quite imperative and there is a lot of repetition. That's some tech debt and I would like it to be properly tracked. Could we resurrect the TODO limit script we had on Jam?

## Actions

Julien: book another mob session :)
