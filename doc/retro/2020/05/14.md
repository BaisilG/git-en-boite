# 2020-05-14

## Who

* Matt

## What happened

* Cleaned lerna out of the repo
* Tidied up the README instructions so people can get started to hack on it
* Tidied up the test scripts a bit
* Meeting with Amplify team to story map git commits

## Insights

* It was a bit frustrating yesterday not to do anything to the code, yet afterwards it was such a huge relief to have lerna gone from the codebase; it had been causing more friction than I had reaslised. So good to know the monorepo approach can work without being too heavyweight.
* I'm happy to be making the code more usable for other devs
* Still puzzled about how I can make it more obvious where people can contribute.
* Still quite frustrated with the coupled design - really itching to do some re-design work before it gets much bigger.

## Actions

* Attend meeting tomorrow with CS team to discuss changing their model to include a revision with a "Living doc" record. Will they need features from git-en-boite to service this? We'll see.
* Show and tell with wider dev / product org to share progress in the afternoon.
* Spike something around the redesign, try to generate some concrete steps that need to be taken.
