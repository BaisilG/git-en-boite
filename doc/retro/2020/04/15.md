# What happened

Where I’m at right now is looking to put the heavy lifting with e.g. git clone operations out of band using bull (a job queue wrapper around redis).

I’ve got a spike here: https://github.com/SmartBear/git-en-boite/tree/spike-bull-queues

You can run the scenario with `./bin/cucumber -p wip`

# Puzzles / concerns

What I’m stuck on is that the cucumber process doesn’t exit, so I think I am not closing / cleaning something up properly.

# Next

It might be that I should not be using bullmq yet - maybe it's not production-ready? it might be better to try with bull v3
