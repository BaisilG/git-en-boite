# What happened

We can connect repos on staging! ðŸŽ‰

    curl -d '{"repoId":"1","remoteUrl":"https://github.com/SmartBear/git-en-boite-demo.git"}' --header "Content-Type: application/json" http://dev.git.smartbear.io/repos

# Puzzles / concerns

* Should we use [HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) for the API resources? There's a [Koa plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/koa-hal). Or [something else?](https://sookocheff.com/post/api/on-choosing-a-hypermedia-format/)
* Duplication of the git setup code in cukes and specs for `local_git_repo(s)`
* Cucumber branches scenario still doesn't do anything with tokens
* At what point do we introduce postgres as a cache in front of git?
* Each app (SwaggerHub, CucumberStudio etc) will have created an OAuth token. We can't share these between apps. How do we create this separation?
* TDD in typescript still not fun in vscode. Could try IntelliJ? Could try the [mocha sidebar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=maty.vscode-mocha-sidebar) and the [js refactoring plugin]()
* How to handle libraries with no types, e.g. `fake-fs` today - that wasted loads of energy
* Need to handle edge cases and errors with connecting repos. Unit tests around the repos route and LocalRepo(s) classes.
* Should we push the connection work into a "back end" task?
* Should we capture/log/surface events?
* The `app` injected into the routers is badly named / shaped. It's just the `GitRepos` right now.
* Injecting `app` into routers seems wrong - too many levels - better to construct the app and pass the routers to that?
* Should we use command / query objects for the app's API?
* Who should create the directory for git repos?

# Next

* Factor out a TestDataBuilder for setting up git repos for tests
* Reshape how the web app is assembled so the routes are passed to the web app
* Rename the `app` passed to the routes or wrap the GitRepos in a facade
* TDD some edge cases / error handling around connecting a repo
