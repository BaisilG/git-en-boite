# Who
* Tim, Marju, Benjamin, Djember, Matt

# What happened

* We ironed out some kinks in the docker-compose setup so it doesn't clash ports with SucumberStudio
* We spiked calling git-en-boite (localhost) from CucumberStudio

# Insights

* Tim: It was easy to clone a git repo; It doesn't have to be complicated!
* Benjamin: We did some bad code writing it in the controiller. It should go somewhere else. An interactor maybe?
* Matt: Need to validate RepoId so it doens't make a sub-folder! (slashes)
* TIm: I'm questioning how we're dealing with a reposotory. We are listing the branches from the ember app, and we don't make the connection until we've already done that. We might need to change the workflow here, so that we link the project to the repo, and then the user can select multiple branches.

# Actions

* List branches through git-en-boite
